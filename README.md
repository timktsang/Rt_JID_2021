realdata3 contains the rcpp code that can run the Rt based on case data, and the proposed method in the paper.





The Rt estimates in 'Comparison of control and transmission of COVID-19 across five epidemic waves in Hong Kong: an observational study' are avaiable in here.

Rts for imported cases for wave 1-3 were in file 'wave 1-3 imported cases Rt.csv'

Rts for local cases for wave 1-4 were in file 'wave 1-4 local cases Rt.csv'
